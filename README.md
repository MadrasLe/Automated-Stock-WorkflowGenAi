**An end-to-end automated pipeline for creating, upscaling, and tagging stock photography assets using State-of-the-Art Generative AI.**

##  Overview

This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools to automate the lifecycle of stock image production. By orchestrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it eliminates the manual bottleneck of prompting and metadata tagging.

**The Pipeline:**
1.  **Ideation & Prompting:** Uses **Llama 3** to create prompts.
2.  **Generation:** Uses **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** (Base + Refiner) to generate images.
3.  **Enhancement:** Applies Deep Learning-based Super-Resolution (**PanModel**) to upscale images for commercial quality.
4.  **Analysis & SEO:** Uses Microsoft's **Florence-2** to analyze images and generate CSV metadata (Title, Description, Keywords) compatible with stock platforms like Dreamstime.

## Architecture & Models

| Stage | Technology / Model | Function |
| **Prompting** | **Llama 3 8B (via Unsloth)** | Expands simple topics into professional photographic prompts (lighting, lens, mood). |
| **Generation** | **SDXL Base 1.0 + Refiner** | Generates latent images |
| **Upscaling** | **PanModel (BAM)** | Upscales images (x4) while preserving texture and detail |
| **Tagging** | **Microsoft Florence-2-base** | Performs Dense Captioning to extract SEO-rich keywords and descriptions automatically. |

Installation

Install dependencies:
Note: A GPU with at least 16GB VRAM is recommended for the full pipeline.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
Phase 1: Generation (generate.py)
Generate high-quality prompts and images based on a simple topic.

```bash
python src/generate.py --topic "Futuristic sustainable city with greenery" --count 5 --steps 40
Outputs: Images saved to ./output_images
```

Phase 2: Upscaling (upscale.py)
Increase image resolution (e.g., x4) for stock submission requirements.

```bash
python src/upscale.py --input "./output_images" --output "./upscaled" --scale 4
```

Phase 3: Analysis & Tagging (analyze.py)
Generate titles, descriptions, and keywords. Exports a .csv file ready for bulk upload.

```bash
python src/analyze.py --input "./upscaled" --categories "Technology" "Abstract" "Business"
Outputs: dreamstime_metadata.csv and dreamstime_metadata.txt
```

⚠️ Disclaimer & Ethics
This tool is intended to assist creators. When uploading to stock platforms (Dreamstime, Adobe Stock, Shutterstock, etc.):
